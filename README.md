1. **`/node_modules`** - The place where all the modules and packages of the project are installed. 

2. **`/public`** - The directory contains the **`index.html`** and **`favicon.png`**, which are not read by the [Webpack](https://survivejs.com/webpack/what-is-webpack/). 

3. **`/src`** - This directory contains all the source code of the project that what we will see in the front-end. And the webpack only reads the files in this directory.

4. **`.gitignore`** - This file will tell the git what are the files to ignore, when pushing to remote. It mentions all the complex, large files like **/node_modules**.

5. **`package-lock.json`** - An automatically genaerated JSON file based on the exact versions of the insatlled npm dependencies. 

6. **`package.json`** - This JSON file contains all the metadata about the project such as project's name, author, dependencies.

7. **`README.md`** - This file is written in markdown, which gives all the refernce information (documentation) about the project.
